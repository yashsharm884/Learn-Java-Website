<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: xx-large;">What is JRE? </h1>


<br>

<br>

<p class="intro_123" align="center">
A software program needs to execute, and to do that it needs an environment to run in. The runtime environment loads class files and ensures there is access to memory and other system resources to run them. In the past, most software used the operating system (OS) as its runtime environment. The program ran inside whatever computer it was on, but relied on operating system settings for resource access. Resources in this case would be things like memory and program files and dependencies. The Java Runtime Environment changed all that, at least for Java programs.The JRE smoothes over the diversity of operating systems, ensuring that Java programs can run on virtually any OS without modification. It also provides value-added services. Automatic memory management is one of the JRE's most important services, ensuring that programmers don't have to manually control the allocation and reallocation of memory.A Java Virtual Machine is a running software system responsible for executing live Java programs. The JRE is the on-disk system that takes your Java code, combines it with the necessary libraries, and starts the JVM to execute it.

The JRE contains libraries and software that your Java programs need to run. As an example, the Java class loader is part of the Java Runtime Environment. This important piece of software loads compiled Java code into memory and connects the code to the appropriate Java class libraries.
The JRE is not very noticeable in the development stage, where it mostly just runs your programs in the OS or IDE of your choice. The JRE plays a slightly more prominent role devops and systems administration because it's used for monitoring and configuration.

Basically, the JRE provides the "knobs" you would use to configure and control the characteristics of a Java application. Memory usage is a prime example, the bread and butter of systems administration. While memory usage is always important, it's vital in cloud configurations, and devops is a cloud-based technology. If you're working in a devops environment, or interested in branching out into devops, it's a good idea to understand how Java memory works and how it's monitored in the JRE.

<p class="intro_123" align="center">
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), also known as Java Runtime, is the part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) that contains and orchestrates the set of tools and minimum requirements for executing a Java application. The JDK, along with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the JRE, can be used by developers to program and run Java applications.

It includes a large number of java development tools and java classes and methods.
The Java development tools are part of the system known as Java Development Kit (JDK) and the classes and the methods in Java are a part of the Java Standard Library (JSL), also known as the Application Programming Interface (API).JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is used to provide runtime environment to the Java code.

The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files.

Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files. It does not contain any development tools such as compiler, debugger, etc. Actually JVM runs the program, and it uses the class libraries, and other supporting files provided in JRE. If you want to run any java program, you need to have JRE installed in the system.
